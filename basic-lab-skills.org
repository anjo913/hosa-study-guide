* Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- protect against specific hazards
- worn at all times
- eye :: safety glasses with side protection >>> splash goggles
- shortwave UV :: full face mask with UV protectant material
- gloves :: latex, nitrile, vinyl
  - latex :: simple barrier
  - heat/cold resistant for extreme temperatures
- feet :: closed-toed shoes
* Pipetting
** vacuum-assisted pipets
- liquid drawn by creating vacuum w/ pump
  - pump can be rubber bulb, motorized pump, etc.
- 1-25 mL
- measure volume at bottom of meniscus
- some have cotton plug inside top
- Pasteur pipet :: glass, no graduation marks; used to transfer liquid
- disposable plastic transfer pipet, bulb pipet :: graduated, but not accurate
  - available in sterile packages
- volumetric :: glass, graduation marks; measure single specific volume very accurately
  - accurate w/ gravity; do _NOT_ blow out remaining liquid
  - 10 mL Class A has 0.02 mL accuracy
- graduated :: glass/plastic cylindrical shape, not as accurate as volumetric
  - Mohr pipets :: dead volume beyond zero mark; do _NOT_ empty
  - serological pipet :: deliver entire contents; blow out last drops
  - 10 mL disposable serological pipet has 0.15 mL accuracy
** micropipets
- measure fixed or adjustable volumes
- <1 mL
- volume ranges :: 0.5-10, 2-20, 20-200, 100-1,000 (uL)
  - most accurate at top of range
- accuracy :: ~0.5-4%
- fresh tip for every new reagent
- mechanisms
