* main agencies
** Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- food + beverages are safe for human consumption
- therapeutic drugs and devices are *safe* and *effective*
** Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- protect human health and envifronment
** U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
- protect agriculture
** Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
- protect safety of workers in workplace

* genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
- research labs :: NIH
- commercial :: other agencies
- food supply :: FDA
  - label _NOT_ required if "substantially equivalent" in nutrition and health
  - organic :: <5% GMO ingredients
  - EU & JP :: if >1% GMO ingredients, label required
- field testing :: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (*APHIS*), sub. of USDA
  - pesticide & herbicide resistance
- environment :: EPA
  - Toxic Substances Control Act Biotechnology Program
    - producing industrial enzymes, chemicals
    - breaking down chemical pollutants
  - microorganisms in agriculture, biosensors, biofuels
* healthcare
- regulating agency :: FDA
- therapeutic drugs, medical devices, diagnostic tools
- safety and efficacy
- good laboratory practice (GLP) :: preclinical research & data meet level of quality
* animal research
- Institutional Animal Care and Use Committe (IACUC) :: oversees animal work in institution
  - need, species selection, fewest subjects
- Animal Welfare Act (AWA) :: care standards during research, requires anesthesia/analgesic
  - through APHIS, USDA
  - does not cover rats & mice (90% of lab research)
- U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Act :: covers lab animals in institutions that receive NIH, FDA, CDC funding
  - must adhere to "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" by National Research Council of the National Academies
* waste disposal
- regulating agency :: EPA
- generation and disposal
- jurisdiction-specific guidelines
** types of waste
*** nonhazardous liquid and solid
*** biohazardous
- medical waste
  - tissue samples, blood, cell/microbe cultures, virus stocks, sharps
- treated by steam sterilization (autoclaving), gas sterilization, or chemical disinfection (e.g. bleach)
- after treatment, nonhazardous
- sharps transported to specialized facilities
*** toxic
- poisonous, radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, bioaccumulative
- chemicals & reagents labelled
- possible disposal
  - seal & bury in landfill
  - incineration
  - microorganisms converting waste to be less toxic
- high cost
* nanotechnology
- no specific regulations
- EPA whitepaper (2007) on info & potential issues
- NIOSH investigating potential health concerns
* workplace safety
- regulating agency :: OSHA (dept. of labor)
- health & safety standards, worksite inspections, PPE necessary
- lab PPE :: lab coat, safety glasses, gloves
- hazardous chemicals, biohazards (microbial cultures, blood-borne pathogens)
- training for hazmat, general safety
- log of injuries & illnesses required
